## About Me

> Oh hi, I didn't see you there!

My name is Jeremy, and I'm a third year at Seventh studying Mathematics-Computer Science. Although I'm somewhat more reserved as a person, people tell me I'm really friendly and easy to get along with.

#### **Some Hobbies of Mine:**
- Wushu
- Rock climbing
- Cycling
- Video Games

[Also me!](./lol.png)

Been doing a lot of wushu recently, here are some of my wushu goals:
- [x] Front splits (on one side)
- [ ] Middle splits
- [x] Butterfly
- [ ] Butterfly Twist
- [x] Aerial

## Programming

- Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/countpearsauce) even though I don't have much
- *Did you know `cmd+k` clears the terminal? Didn't know until recently*

Order that I learned Programming Languages
1. Java
2. C
3. C++
4. Python

My favorite language is java (it is my first, afterall), though you got to love java everytime you (forget how to) type this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

}
```
